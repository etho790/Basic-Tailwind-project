# Basic-Tailwind-project

This project was made using javascript & html using classes derived from the tailwind library.

The Project essentially is a basic food website that is styled using tailwind & is fully responsive. 
Moreover this project was an attempt at creating a basic website aimed at introducing the tailwind library whilst making it a fun & familiar library to work with.   

The app.js only contains logic in terms of opening and closing the hamburger menu when the size of the screen is reduced to bring it up.
Whereas all styling & the creation of all elements are contained in the html file.
